## Completed Components
- ✅ Core quality assessment models and data structures
- ✅ Individual note quality assessment (`assess_note_quality`)
- ✅ Vault-wide quality distribution analysis (`analyze_quality_distribution`)
- ✅ MCP tool integration (`assess-quality` plugin)
- ✅ Quality scoring algorithm with multi-dimensional assessment
- ✅ Basic improvement suggestions generation
- ✅ Connection metrics analysis
- ✅ Quality gap identification framework

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

## Notes
- The core quality assessment engine is functional and meets basic requirements
- Real-time assessment (Requirement 4) is the highest priority missing feature
- Configuration customization (Requirement 5) needs significant implementation
- Most data models and interfaces are complete and well-designed
- The MCP integration is working but could be enhanced with additional capabilities
- Performance optimization will be critical for large vault deployments
