# Requirements Document

Alignment Note (2025-09-11):
- This feature aligns with the existing Vault Analytics Engine; quality scoring and distribution are delivered via analytics services and MCP tools rather than a separate agent runtime.
- Remaining work emphasizes real-time/incremental assessment, configuration surfaces, trend tracking, and result caching/persistence.

## Introduction

This feature introduces AI-powered Quality Assessment Agents that automatically analyze Obsidian vault content to provide intelligent quality scoring, improvement recommendations, and content optimization suggestions. The agents will integrate with the existing Jarvis Assistant architecture to provide actionable insights about knowledge base quality and organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want automated quality assessment of my notes, so that I can identify which notes need improvement and understand how to enhance them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests quality assessment THEN the system SHALL analyze individual notes and provide quality scores from 0.0 to 1.0
2. WHEN quality assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL categorize notes using quality levels (üå± Seedling, üåø Growing, üå≥ Mature, üó∫Ô∏è Comprehensive)
3. WHEN a note receives a quality score THEN the system SHALL provide specific improvement suggestions with estimated effort levels
4. WHEN quality assessment runs THEN the system SHALL evaluate completeness, structure, connections, and freshness dimensions
5. WHEN assessment identifies issues THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations by impact and effort required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to understand the overall quality distribution of my knowledge base, so that I can identify patterns and focus my improvement efforts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vault-wide quality assessment runs THEN the system SHALL provide quality distribution statistics across all notes
2. WHEN quality analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge domains and their respective quality levels
3. WHEN analyzing vault structure THEN the system SHALL detect isolated notes and suggest connection opportunities
4. WHEN assessment finds quality gaps THEN the system SHALL recommend bridge notes to connect related concepts
5. WHEN quality trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL track quality improvements over time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI system integrating with Jarvis Assistant, I want structured quality assessment data, so that I can provide intelligent recommendations and automate content improvement workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality assessment completes THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON data with quality metrics and recommendations
2. WHEN AI systems request quality data THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable quality indicators with confidence scores
3. WHEN quality assessment runs THEN the system SHALL include actionable improvement suggestions with specific implementation guidance
4. WHEN assessment identifies patterns THEN the system SHALL provide structured insights about content organization and knowledge gaps
5. WHEN quality data is requested THEN the system SHALL include metadata about assessment methodology and confidence levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want real-time quality feedback as I write, so that I can improve my notes during the creation process rather than after.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a note is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger incremental quality assessment
2. WHEN quality assessment detects changes THEN the system SHALL update quality scores without full vault re-analysis
3. WHEN real-time assessment runs THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 5 seconds for individual notes
4. WHEN quality feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL highlight specific areas for improvement with contextual suggestions
5. WHEN incremental assessment occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with vault-wide quality metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable quality assessment criteria, so that I can customize the assessment to match specific knowledge management standards and organizational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quality assessment is configured THEN the system SHALL allow customization of scoring weights for different quality dimensions
2. WHEN assessment criteria are set THEN the system SHALL support custom quality thresholds for different note types
3. WHEN quality standards are defined THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of domain-specific assessment rules
4. WHEN assessment runs THEN the system SHALL respect configured performance limits and resource constraints
5. WHEN quality criteria change THEN the system SHALL provide migration tools to update existing assessments
