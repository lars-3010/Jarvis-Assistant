# Structured Data Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Structured Data Enhancement feature transforms existing MCP tools from text-based responses to structured, programmatically analyzable JSON responses. This enhancement implements the "Structured Data as Lingua Franca" principle from the strategic framework, enabling Claude to perform complex reasoning and automated analysis on search results, vault statistics, and system information.

This feature ensures backward compatibility while adding rich metadata, confidence scores, and actionable insights that empower AI systems to make data-driven decisions rather than parsing human-readable text.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Search Results with Structured Metadata

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want search results in structured JSON format with rich metadata, so that I can programmatically analyze result types, scores, and relationships for intelligent reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with result type, confidence scores, and semantic similarity metrics
2. WHEN performing keyword search THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with match positions, match types, and relevance indicators
3. WHEN performing graph search THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON with connection strengths, relationship paths, and graph metrics
4. WHEN performing combined search THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON differentiating between semantic, keyword, and graph results with unified scoring
5. IF search results include quality indicators THEN the system SHALL provide quality scores and improvement suggestions in structured format

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Result Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want analytical insights about search results, so that I can understand result distribution, suggest follow-up queries, and identify knowledge patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning search results THEN the system SHALL include result distribution analytics (semantic vs keyword vs graph counts)
2. WHEN analyzing result quality THEN the system SHALL provide quality distribution metrics and average quality scores
3. WHEN processing search queries THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant follow-up queries based on result patterns
4. WHEN identifying knowledge gaps THEN the system SHALL highlight underrepresented topics and missing connections
5. IF search performance varies THEN the system SHALL include timing metrics and performance indicators

### Requirement 3: Vault Statistics with Actionable Intelligence

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want comprehensive vault statistics in structured format, so that I can understand vault health, identify optimization opportunities, and provide intelligent recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting vault statistics THEN the system SHALL return structured data including note counts, size metrics, and organizational patterns
2. WHEN analyzing vault health THEN the system SHALL provide health indicators, quality distributions, and improvement recommendations
3. WHEN assessing vault performance THEN the system SHALL include indexing status, search performance metrics, and system resource usage
4. WHEN identifying vault trends THEN the system SHALL provide growth patterns, activity metrics, and usage statistics
5. IF vault issues are detected THEN the system SHALL include specific problem descriptions and recommended solutions

### Requirement 4: System Information with Operational Context

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want detailed system information in structured format, so that I can understand system capabilities, health status, and operational context for intelligent decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting system health THEN the system SHALL return structured status information for all components with health indicators
2. WHEN checking service availability THEN the system SHALL provide service status, performance metrics, and capability information
3. WHEN analyzing system performance THEN the system SHALL include resource usage, response times, and throughput metrics
4. WHEN identifying system issues THEN the system SHALL provide error details, impact assessment, and recovery recommendations
5. IF system configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updated capabilities and feature availability

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility and Migration Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing integrations to continue working while gaining access to enhanced structured data, so that I can migrate to new capabilities without breaking existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing clients request data THEN the system SHALL continue to provide text-based responses by default
2. WHEN clients request structured data THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced JSON responses with opt-in mechanism
3. WHEN migrating to structured responses THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths and compatibility guidelines
4. WHEN supporting mixed usage THEN the system SHALL handle both text and structured response formats simultaneously
5. IF response format conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize backward compatibility with clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability with Enhanced Data

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want structured data enhancements to maintain system performance, so that enhanced capabilities don't compromise response times or resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating structured responses THEN the system SHALL maintain response times within 10% of current performance
2. WHEN processing enhanced metadata THEN the system SHALL limit memory overhead to less than 20% increase
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain throughput with structured data generation
4. WHEN caching structured responses THEN the system SHALL optimize cache efficiency and hit rates
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide fallback to simplified structured responses with performance indicators
