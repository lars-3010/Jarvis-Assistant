# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the existing documentation for Jarvis Assistant, specifically targeting architecture and concepts documentation. The current documentation is already comprehensive and well-structured, but there are opportunities to improve clarity, add missing technical details, and enhance the developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer new to the codebase, I want clear architectural diagrams and explanations, so that I can quickly understand how components interact and where to make changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the architecture documentation THEN they SHALL understand the complete system flow from MCP request to database response
2. WHEN a developer needs to add a new MCP tool THEN they SHALL have clear guidance on the required interfaces and patterns
3. WHEN a developer wants to understand service interactions THEN they SHALL see detailed sequence diagrams showing the flow between services
4. WHEN a developer needs to understand the dependency injection system THEN they SHALL have concrete examples of how services are registered and resolved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on performance optimization, I want detailed technical specifications and performance characteristics, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer analyzes performance issues THEN they SHALL have access to detailed performance benchmarks and bottleneck identification
2. WHEN a developer needs to optimize database queries THEN they SHALL understand the query patterns and indexing strategies used
3. WHEN a developer wants to understand caching behavior THEN they SHALL see detailed cache hierarchy and invalidation strategies
4. WHEN a developer needs to scale the system THEN they SHALL understand current limitations and scaling approaches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI system or developer tool, I want machine-readable architecture information, so that I can automatically understand the system structure and generate code or documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI system reads the architecture documentation THEN it SHALL find structured data about component interfaces and relationships
2. WHEN an AI system needs to understand data flow THEN it SHALL have access to formal specifications of request/response patterns
3. WHEN an AI system wants to generate code THEN it SHALL understand the coding patterns and conventions used throughout the system
4. WHEN an AI system needs to understand error handling THEN it SHALL have structured information about error types and recovery patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system with new features, I want comprehensive extension and plugin architecture documentation, so that I can build compatible extensions without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to create a new search strategy THEN they SHALL understand the Strategy pattern implementation and required interfaces
2. WHEN a developer needs to add a new database adapter THEN they SHALL have clear guidance on the Repository pattern and connection management
3. WHEN a developer wants to add new MCP tools THEN they SHALL understand the plugin registration and lifecycle management
4. WHEN a developer needs to integrate with the event system THEN they SHALL understand event types, publishing, and subscription patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator or DevOps engineer, I want detailed deployment and operational documentation, so that I can deploy, monitor, and maintain the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator deploys the system THEN they SHALL understand all configuration options and their performance implications
2. WHEN an administrator monitors the system THEN they SHALL understand key metrics and alerting thresholds
3. WHEN an administrator troubleshoots issues THEN they SHALL have detailed error codes and resolution procedures
4. WHEN an administrator needs to backup or migrate data THEN they SHALL understand data storage patterns and migration procedures
