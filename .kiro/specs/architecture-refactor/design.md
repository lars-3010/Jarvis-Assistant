# Architecture Refactor & Codebase Clarity — Design

## Scope
- Analysis + ADRs
- Boundaries & composition improvements
- Registry integration (reduce duplication)
- Docs refresh

## Deliverables
1. Architecture Map (current state) — modules, data flow, services
2. ADRs — DI container usage in MCP server; structured response module; event-driven analytics invalidation
3. Refactor Plan — small, reversible steps; test coverage strategy
4. Docs — updated architecture chapter; quick reference

## Non-Goals
- No major rewrites; prefer incremental, low-risk changes
- Keep behavior intact; focus on structure and clarity
