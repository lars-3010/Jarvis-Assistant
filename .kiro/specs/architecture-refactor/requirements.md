# Architecture Refactor & Codebase Clarity â€” Requirements

## Introduction

Restore clarity and velocity by analyzing the codebase, tightening boundaries, reducing duplication, and updating docs to match reality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Codebase Analysis & ADRs
1. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN the system SHALL produce an up-to-date architecture map and a set of ADRs for key decisions
2. WHEN identifying hotspots THEN the system SHALL propose concrete refactors with risk/benefit notes

### Requirement 2: Boundary Clarification
1. WHEN organizing modules THEN the system SHALL enforce clear boundaries between MCP tools, services, databases, and extensions
2. WHEN duplications exist THEN the system SHALL extract shared modules (e.g., structured serializers)

### Requirement 3: Registry Integration
1. WHEN listing/executing tools THEN the server SHALL leverage the plugin registry to avoid manual duplication (where practical)

### Requirement 4: Documentation Refresh
1. WHEN refactoring completes THEN the docs SHALL reflect actual architecture and include quick references for services and tool schemas
