# Vault Analytics Engine - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

Status Overview (2025-09-11):
- ✅ Core service orchestrator exists (`VaultAnalyticsService`)
- ✅ Tools implemented: `get-vault-context`, `assess-quality`, `analyze-domains`
- ✅ Caching infrastructure present with L1/L2 distinctions
- ⏳ Event-driven cache invalidation pending wiring to watcher/indexer
- ⏳ Freshness/confidence fields need to be standardized across outputs
- ⏳ Trend tracking and analytics cache tools are pending

This implementation plan converts the Vault Analytics Engine design into a series of incremental coding tasks. Each task builds on previous work and includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and performance.

The implementation follows a bottom-up approach: data models → core analyzers → service integration → MCP tools → optimization.
