# Vault Analytics Engine - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vault Analytics Engine is a comprehensive analytical system that provides intelligent insights into vault structure, content quality, and knowledge organization. This system enables AI assistants to programmatically understand vault characteristics, identify improvement opportunities, and provide contextual recommendations.

The engine serves as the foundation for enhanced AI-Jarvis communication by shifting from text-based responses to structured, analyzable data that enables sophisticated reasoning and automated knowledge management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vault Context Generation

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to instantly understand the structure and characteristics of a vault, so that I can provide contextually relevant recommendations and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI requests vault context THEN the system SHALL return a structured overview including note counts, quality distribution, domain clusters, and organizational patterns
2. WHEN analyzing vault structure THEN the system SHALL identify PARA methodology sections (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) and their relative maturity
3. WHEN calculating quality metrics THEN the system SHALL assess note completeness, connection density, and content depth using standardized scoring
4. WHEN detecting domain clusters THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge areas based on semantic similarity and connection patterns
5. IF a vault has multiple organizational patterns THEN the system SHALL detect and report the primary organizational methodology used

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to understand the quality and completeness of my vault, so that I can identify areas needing attention and improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing note quality THEN the system SHALL evaluate completeness, structure, connections, and content depth
2. WHEN calculating quality scores THEN the system SHALL use consistent metrics (üå± seedling, üåø growing, üå≥ mature, üó∫Ô∏è comprehensive)
3. WHEN identifying quality gaps THEN the system SHALL highlight notes with low connection density or incomplete content
4. WHEN analyzing content distribution THEN the system SHALL identify over-developed and under-developed knowledge areas
5. IF quality patterns change over time THEN the system SHALL track and report quality trends

### Requirement 3: Structured Data API

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to receive vault analytics in structured, programmatically analyzable format, so that I can perform complex reasoning and automated analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning analytics data THEN the system SHALL provide JSON-structured responses with standardized schemas
2. WHEN including metadata THEN the system SHALL provide creation dates, modification times, connection counts, and quality indicators
3. WHEN reporting statistics THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores, processing times, and data freshness indicators
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include actionable suggestions with priority levels and rationale
5. IF data is incomplete or stale THEN the system SHALL indicate data quality and suggest refresh actions

### Requirement 4: Domain Knowledge Mapping

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to understand how knowledge domains are connected in my vault, so that I can identify knowledge gaps and bridge opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping knowledge domains THEN the system SHALL identify distinct subject areas based on content analysis and connection patterns
2. WHEN analyzing domain connections THEN the system SHALL measure connection strength between different knowledge areas
3. WHEN identifying knowledge gaps THEN the system SHALL highlight weakly connected or isolated knowledge domains
4. WHEN suggesting bridge opportunities THEN the system SHALL recommend specific connections between related but unlinked domains
5. IF domain boundaries are unclear THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for domain classifications

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want vault analytics to perform efficiently even with large vaults, so that the system remains responsive and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing vault analytics THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 15 seconds for vaults up to 10,000 notes
2. WHEN caching results THEN the system SHALL store computed analytics and refresh only when vault content changes
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL support multiple simultaneous analytics operations without performance degradation
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and partial analysis modes
5. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback to cached or partial results

### Requirement 6: Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analytics engine to integrate seamlessly with existing Jarvis components, so that it enhances rather than disrupts current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing services THEN the system SHALL use the established dependency injection container and service interfaces
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide plugin points for additional analytical capabilities
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing logging and monitoring systems
4. WHEN updating analytics THEN the system SHALL publish events through the existing event bus for other components to consume
5. IF analytics services are unavailable THEN existing MCP tools SHALL continue to function with graceful degradation
