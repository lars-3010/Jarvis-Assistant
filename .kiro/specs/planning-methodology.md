# Jarvis Assistant - Spec-Driven Development Methodology

## Philosophy

Spec-driven development ensures we build exactly what's needed with high quality by planning thoroughly before coding. This methodology transforms ideas into requirements, requirements into designs, and designs into actionable implementation tasks.

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Feature Identification & Prioritization
**Goal**: Identify and prioritize features that deliver maximum strategic value

**Process**:
1. **Strategic Alignment**: Evaluate against "AI Strategist vs Jarvis COO" framework
2. **Impact Assessment**: Measure potential impact on AI-Jarvis communication effectiveness
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Understand prerequisites and architectural implications
4. **Resource Estimation**: Rough sizing for planning purposes

**Outputs**:
- Feature priority matrix
- Strategic alignment assessment
- High-level resource estimates

### Stage 2: Requirements Gathering
**Goal**: Define precise user needs and acceptance criteria

**Process**:
1. **User Story Creation**: Write stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
2. **EARS Format**: Convert to "WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]" acceptance criteria
3. **Edge Case Analysis**: Identify boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria

**Quality Gates**:
- All user stories have clear business value
- Acceptance criteria are testable and unambiguous
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- Success metrics are specific and measurable

### Stage 3: Technical Design
**Goal**: Create implementable technical architecture with modular, AI-assistant-friendly design

**Process**:
1. **Architecture Research**: Study existing codebase and integration points
2. **Component Boundary Analysis**: Define optimal file/component size limits (200-300 lines max)
3. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document key architectural decisions with rationale
4. **Component Design**: Define interfaces, data models, and service interactions
5. **Modular Planning**: Apply single responsibility principle at file level
6. **Data Flow Mapping**: Document how data moves through the system
7. **Scalability Pre-Planning**: Define how each component will scale and extend
8. **Component Interaction Mapping**: Visualize relationships and identify circular dependencies
9. **Error Handling Strategy**: Plan for failure modes and recovery
10. **Performance Considerations**: Address scalability and resource usage
11. **AI Assistant Compatibility**: Ensure components are readable and manageable by AI tools

**Quality Gates**:
- Design integrates cleanly with existing architecture
- All requirements are addressed in the design
- Component boundaries follow single responsibility principle
- File size limits support AI assistant interaction (max 200-300 lines)
- Architecture decisions are documented in ADRs
- Extension points and plugin architectures are planned
- Performance targets are realistic and measurable
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Clean dependency injection patterns are defined

### Stage 4: Task Planning
**Goal**: Break design into actionable coding tasks with architectural consciousness

**Process**:
1. **Task Decomposition**: Break design into discrete, testable units
2. **Component Extraction Planning**: Plan natural breaking points for future decomposition
3. **Interface Design First**: Define interfaces before implementation details
4. **Dependency Ordering**: Sequence tasks to build incrementally with composition over inheritance
5. **File Size Monitoring**: Plan tasks to maintain optimal file sizes throughout development
6. **Test Strategy**: Define testing approach for each task with testability boundaries
7. **Iterative Decomposition Strategy**: Plan phases for interface design → core implementation → decomposition review
8. **Success Criteria**: Specify completion criteria for each task

**Quality Gates**:
- Each task is independently testable
- Tasks build incrementally without big jumps
- Interface contracts are defined before implementation
- All design components are covered by tasks
- File size limits are planned and monitored
- Natural extraction points are identified
- Success criteria are clear and measurable
- Composition patterns are preferred over inheritance

### Stage 5: Implementation & Validation
**Goal**: Execute tasks with continuous validation

**Process**:
1. **Incremental Development**: Complete tasks in dependency order
2. **Continuous Testing**: Test each task thoroughly before proceeding
3. **Integration Validation**: Ensure components work together
4. **Requirements Verification**: Validate against original requirements

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests pass before task completion
- Integration points work correctly
- Performance meets specified targets
- Requirements are fully satisfied
