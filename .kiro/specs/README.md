# Jarvis Assistant Specs

This directory contains feature specifications following the spec-driven development methodology.

## Spec Structure

Each spec follows a three-document approach:
- `requirements.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format
- `design.md` - Technical architecture and implementation approach  
- `tasks.md` - Actionable implementation tasks for coding agents

## Active Specs

- `vault-analytics-engine/` - Intelligent vault analysis and context generation system
- `structured-data-enhancement/` - Enhanced MCP tool responses with structured JSON

## Spec Workflow

1. **Requirements Gathering** - Define user needs and acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase** - Create technical architecture and component design
3. **Task Planning** - Break down into actionable coding tasks
4. **Implementation** - Execute tasks incrementally with testing
5. **Review & Iteration** - Validate against requirements and refine

## Guidelines

- Focus on incremental value delivery
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow local-first, privacy-focused principles
- Ensure comprehensive testing coverage
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
