# Enhanced Search Context - Requirements Document

Scope Adjustment (2025-09-11):
- This spec is reframed as an opt-in, MVP-first approach that follows Structured Data and GraphRAG MVP.
- Default behavior remains stateless; context is explicitly enabled and bounded (expiry, size limits).
- Advanced learning/personalization remains feature-flagged for later phases.

## Introduction

The Enhanced Search Context feature transforms search operations from simple query-response interactions into intelligent, context-aware conversations. This system maintains search context across multiple queries, learns from user patterns, and provides increasingly relevant results through contextual understanding and adaptive ranking.

This enhancement enables AI assistants to conduct sophisticated research sessions, build upon previous searches, and provide contextually relevant recommendations that improve over time. The system maintains privacy by keeping all context and learning local to the user's machine.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent Search Context Management

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to maintain context across multiple related searches, so that I can provide increasingly relevant results and build upon previous discoveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL maintain a search session context that includes previous queries, results, and user interactions
2. WHEN analyzing search patterns THEN the system SHALL identify related queries and group them into coherent research sessions
3. WHEN providing search results THEN the system SHALL consider previous search context to improve relevance ranking and result selection
4. WHEN a search session becomes stale THEN the system SHALL automatically expire context after configurable timeout periods
5. IF context storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently prune older or less relevant context while preserving important patterns

### Requirement 2: Contextual Result Ranking and Filtering

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want search results that consider my previous searches and interests, so that I receive increasingly relevant and personalized results without manual filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ranking search results THEN the system SHALL boost results related to previous search topics and user-selected content
2. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL de-emphasize previously seen content unless specifically relevant to current context
3. WHEN detecting search patterns THEN the system SHALL identify user preferences for content types, sources, and topics
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest related searches based on current context and historical patterns
5. IF user explicitly indicates interest THEN the system SHALL learn from positive feedback and adjust future rankings accordingly

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Query Enhancement and Expansion

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to enhance user queries with contextual information, so that searches become more precise and comprehensive without requiring explicit query refinement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a search query THEN the system SHALL analyze context to identify implicit search intent and expand query terms appropriately
2. WHEN detecting ambiguous queries THEN the system SHALL use context to disambiguate terms and focus search scope
3. WHEN identifying incomplete queries THEN the system SHALL suggest query completions based on context and common patterns
4. WHEN recognizing follow-up queries THEN the system SHALL automatically include relevant context from previous searches
5. IF query expansion reduces result quality THEN the system SHALL fall back to original query with context indicators

### Requirement 4: Cross-Domain Knowledge Discovery

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want the system to identify connections between different knowledge domains in my searches, so that I can discover unexpected relationships and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing search results across sessions THEN the system SHALL identify connections between different knowledge domains and topics
2. WHEN detecting cross-domain patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight potential knowledge bridges and unexpected relationships
3. WHEN providing search results THEN the system SHALL include serendipitous discoveries that relate to broader research context
4. WHEN building knowledge maps THEN the system SHALL track how different search topics connect and influence each other
5. IF cross-domain connections are weak THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and rationale for suggested relationships

### Requirement 5: Adaptive Learning and Personalization

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the search system to learn from my behavior and preferences, so that it becomes more effective and personalized over time while respecting my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking user interactions THEN the system SHALL learn from result selections, time spent on content, and follow-up searches
2. WHEN building user profiles THEN the system SHALL identify preferences for content depth, source types, and topic areas
3. WHEN adapting search behavior THEN the system SHALL adjust ranking algorithms based on learned preferences and success patterns
4. WHEN detecting preference changes THEN the system SHALL adapt to evolving user interests and research focus areas
5. IF privacy concerns arise THEN the system SHALL provide controls for learning behavior and allow context/profile reset

### Requirement 6: Context-Aware Search Suggestions and Guidance

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want intelligent search suggestions and guidance based on my current context, so that I can discover relevant information more efficiently and avoid research dead ends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing search suggestions THEN the system SHALL recommend queries that build logically on current research context
2. WHEN detecting research gaps THEN the system SHALL suggest searches to fill knowledge gaps or explore related areas
3. WHEN identifying successful search patterns THEN the system SHALL recommend similar approaches for new research topics
4. WHEN recognizing research obstacles THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search strategies or query reformulations
5. IF suggestions are consistently ignored THEN the system SHALL learn to adjust suggestion algorithms and reduce irrelevant recommendations
