"""Feature modules (optional, higher-level capabilities).

This package is a staging area for non-core, heavier features that build on the
platform layer (MCP + vector/vault/graph services). Keeping them separate helps
maintain clear boundaries and fast core iterations.

Example planned subpackages:
- analytics: vault analytics and quality/domain analysis
- graphrag: graph-augmented retrieval components
