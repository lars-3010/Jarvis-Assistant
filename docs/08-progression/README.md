# System Progression & Version Tracking

This directory tracks the evolution of Jarvis Assistant through different phases and versions, documenting key milestones, architectural changes, and lessons learned.

## Structure

- **[version-history.md](version-history.md)** - Complete chronological version history
- **[current-phase.md](current-phase.md)** - Current development phase status and next steps
- **[milestone-log.md](milestone-log.md)** - Detailed milestone completion records
- **[architectural-evolution.md](architectural-evolution.md)** - How the system architecture has evolved
- **[lessons-learned.md](lessons-learned.md)** - Key insights and decision rationale

## Current Status

**Version**: 4.0 (2025-07-14)  
**Phase**: Phase 0 Foundation (COMPLETE) â†’ Phase 1 LLM Integration  
**Plan Document**: [PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md)

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Update milestone-log.md** when completing PLAN.md checkbox items
2. **Update current-phase.md** when transitioning between phases
3. **Document architectural changes** in architectural-evolution.md
4. **Record lessons learned** after each major milestone
5. **Maintain version-history.md** for comprehensive tracking

## Integration with PLAN.md

This progression tracking system is tightly integrated with [PLAN.md](../../PLAN.md):

- PLAN.md contains the strategic roadmap and implementation details
- This directory tracks actual progress against that plan
- Updates to PLAN.md checkboxes should be reflected here
- Lessons learned here should inform future planning iterations
