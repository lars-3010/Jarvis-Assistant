# Current Phase Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-14

## Active Phase: Phase 1 - Local LLM Integration (ENHANCED)

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Status**: Ready to Begin  
**Previous Phase**: Phase 0 Extension Foundation (COMPLETE)

### Current Focus

**Phase 1 Objectives**:
- Foundation for all AI capabilities within extension framework
- Configurable model routing system for task-specific optimization
- Basic generation, summarization, and analysis tools
- Ollama integration with multi-model management
- Flexible model configuration through JarvisSettings

### Implementation Milestones (Week-by-Week)

**Week 1-2: Foundation & Model Configuration**
- [ ] Create enhanced LLM service interfaces with task-specific routing
- [ ] Implement configurable model routing system
- [ ] Add comprehensive LLM settings to JarvisSettings configuration
- [ ] Create prompt template system with Jinja2
- [ ] Implement Ollama client with multi-model support

**Week 3-4: Core Functionality & Task Optimization**
- [ ] Implement task-specific methods (summarize, analyze, quick_answer)
- [ ] Add streaming response support for real-time feedback
- [ ] Create intelligent model management (download, switch, cache)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and timeout management
- [ ] Implement performance optimization for M4 Pro hardware

**Week 5-6: Integration & MCP Tools**
- [ ] Integrate LLM service with ServiceContainer
- [ ] Create first MCP tools using LLM (`llm-summarize`, `llm-analyze`, `llm-quick`)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and resource usage metrics
- [ ] Implement model health monitoring and automatic fallbacks
- [ ] Complete test suite and documentation

### Success Metrics

- **Performance**: <3s cold start, <1-2s warm response time for 7B models
- **Resource Usage**: <5GB memory for 7B models, <9GB for 13B models
- **Quality**: >4/5 human evaluation for summarization, >3.5/5 for analysis
- **Reliability**: >99% uptime, <1% error rate for valid requests
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for 3+ models with runtime switching
- **Task Optimization**: 50% faster responses through intelligent model routing

### Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2: Enhanced GraphRAG & Quality Agents (8-10 weeks)**
- Context-aware search combining vector + graph + generation
- Duplication Detection Agent for content overlap analysis
- Atomic Boundary Analyzer for optimal note splitting
- Visual Enhancement Engine for diagram recommendations
- Multi-modal retrieval with intelligent context assembly

### Key Decisions & Assumptions

1. **Ollama as Primary LLM Provider**: Chosen for local-first approach and model flexibility
2. **Task-Specific Model Routing**: Optimize performance through specialized models
3. **M4 Pro Hardware Optimization**: Target Apple Silicon for optimal performance
4. **Extension Architecture**: Maintain zero-impact design for core system
5. **Gradual Feature Rollout**: Build confidence before advancing to complex agents

### Blockers & Risks

**Potential Blockers**:
- Ollama server stability and performance
- Model quantization and memory optimization
- Integration complexity with existing service container

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Progressive model loading and caching strategies
- Extensive testing with real-world usage patterns
